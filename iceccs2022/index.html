                Different kinds of contributions are sought, including novel research, lessons learned, experience reports, and discussions of practical problems faced by industry and user domains. The ultimate goal is to build a rich and comprehensive conference program that can fit the interests and needs of different classes of attendees: professionals, researchers, managers, and students. A program goal is to organize several sessions that include both academic and industrial papers on a given topic and culminate panels to discuss relationships between industrial and academic research.

            <p class="mb-2 text-white"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computers play an increasingly important role in society, being both ubiquitous and critical to systems that operate our homes, transport, communications, manufacturing, energy, health, defence etc. Yet, the cost to achieve large, complex IT systems design, test, delivery, operation and maintenance continues to accelerate, with systems often failing to meet performance expectations. In contrast to the “large, complex and few” proprietary integrated IT systems, the Internet of Things is illustrative of a vision for the future of “small, smart and many” systems. The future for society is where computing is adaptable, embedded in everything, autonomous, fully human-machine-decision integrated, physically distributed, goals are decentralised, socially coordinated with managed levels of control. The engineering of this vision, in turn raises new challenges for complex computer systems to solve that will be outlined in the talk, and include: 
              Mutually understood human-machine semantics; 
              Dynamic validation of a proposed complex of system contracts that meets operator goals, just prior to a new deployment rather than at “design time” (ensuring the system “does the right thing”);
              On-line verification that elements of the composed system will not exceed behavioural constraints or policies just prior to and during deployment (ensuring the system “does things right”); (eg TLA+) 
              Means for human to dynamically monitor and break contracts during deployment; 
              The ability for the computing system complex to predict its own limits of performance and adapt or break the contract, while informing the user; 
              Legal agreement protocol that brings the power of contract law to formalise contractual agreements including “consideration” for the flow of payments for systems and services developed by any company;
              Assessment of the consequences of breaking contract and remedies for doing so; and 
              Means for handling adversarial agents inside the system through reputation and system-wide monitoring and governance.  </p>

His research reduces users' reliance on trusting third-parties and focusses on (1) provenance logging and reconstruction, traceability and (2) privacy-preserving data processing. Both his research foci are recognised nationally and internationally, receiving conference Best Paper Awards (2011, 2015, 2017), and technology transfers locally and internationally. Prior to UQ, he held scientific leadership positions at Hewlett Packard Labs and University of Waikato, New Zealand.
